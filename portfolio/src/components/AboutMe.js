                <p>
                    My name is Drew Johnson, a React Engineer from the scenic
                    state of Montana. With a passion for continuous learning, I
                    thrive on exploring new languages, libraries, and techniques
                    to enhance my coding skills. <br />
                    <br />I began my journey as a graduate of Lambda School (now
                    known as BloomTech), a renowned institution celebrated for
                    nurturing top-tier developers. Since then, I've had the
                    privilege of working with multiple companies, each providing
                    unique challenges and opportunities. <br />
                    <br />
                    At ELM Utility Services, I contributed to SightRight, led
                    the front-end development for Launchpoint Portal, and
                    engaged in various other exciting legacy projects. My
                    current roles include serving as the Senior React Engineer
                    at Channel Program and working on numerous projects at
                    UtiliSource. <br />
                    <br />
                    My love for coding goes beyond the workplace. I'm always on
                    the lookout for new ways to innovate and improve, and I'm
                    eager to bring my skillset to new and exciting ventures.
